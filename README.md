A simple repository of notes and basic Python scripts from the EdX course "IBM: PY0101EN - Python Basics for Data Science"

The EdX course can be found at the following link: [IBM: PY0101EN](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IBM+PY0101EN+1T2019/course/#block-v1:IBM+PY0101EN+1T2019+type@sequential+block@f1f769d2df4e4fedb5d4fa44e3dcfd21) on EdX.com

The course also works well to learn Git and GitHub. For an introduction on how to use GitHub refer to the [Hello World GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and at [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
